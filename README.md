Solving [Preppin' Data Challenges](https://preppindata.blogspot.com/) 2024 challenges with Python

## :clipboard: About 

After many fulfilling years on the managerial side of the data science field, I decided to 
take an exciting career shift in 2024 and return to the specialist path. I was really missing 
the thrill of getting my hands dirty with some cool projects! Naturally, after a few years 
without much hands-on work, I needed to brush up on my skills. That's when I stumbled upon 
the Data Preparation Challenge. It seemed like a good first step to dive back in! The challenge
is designed to be tackled with Tableau Prep, but it can definitely be approached with Python, R,
SQL, and other tools. I chose Python because I'm more comfortable with it.

### :bar_chart: Data Visualization
Besides solving the data preparation challenges, for some of them I also created a data 
visualization using Tableau. You can find the link to them below:
